# Nirvic Arch Guide

This guide explains how I install Arch Linux for my daily system. The setup is manual for now because I have not finished creating my full dotfiles. I prefer keeping everything manual at this stage so the system stays clean and easy to adjust.

I also have a simple dotfiles setup in my repository called "niriha". It is a basic and lightweight configuration that works as a temporary setup or a starting point before moving to the full Nirvic setup.

In this guide, I explain how I prepare and configure my Arch system for both Niri and Hyprland. I use different styles depending on the workflow I want. This includes layout choices, theming, fonts, window manager settings, and the overall structure of the system.

The goal is to create a clean and customizable Arch environment that works well with Niri and Hyprland while keeping the setup flexible and easy to switch between styles.
